# Intro

Thank you for picking up this book. Hopefully you are here to learn more about the art of software testing. You might be a developer early on in your career, or a test lead trying to scale a team quality mindset or a product manager helping a team with a new project. If you work with software and are interested in deliverying quality products, there's something for you in this book.

You don't need to read this book from start to finish. Pick a chapter, skim through and try to practice something new in your work or share an idea with a colleague. This book is about helping you collaborate with your team. Even though this book is about software testing, there won't be a huge amount of technical detail. This book is more "hints and tips" for thinking about testing over a technical deep dive.
